About _<<gene>>_ mutations:

ABOUT_GENE.CONTENT -- APC

Testing positive for a <<classification>> variant (also called a mutation) in
the _APC_ gene means your risk of developing colorectal cancer is greater than
that of the average US <<man/woman>>. Your risks of developing brain, pancreatic,
stomach, and small bowel cancers are also increased by this mutation.

ABOUT_GENE.CONTENT -- APC  I1307K

Testing positive for a <<classification>> mutation in the _APC_ gene means
your risk of developing colorectal cancer is greater than that of the
average US <<man/woman>>. Specifically, the mutation that was identified is called
I1307K, a common mutation in certain populations that only slightly
increases cancer risk.

ABOUT_GENE.CONTENT_MORE -- APC

Mutations in the _APC_ gene can cause one of two conditions: familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis
(AFAP). Both of these are hereditary conditions that are associated with
polyposis (a large number of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract) as well
as an increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. Because the cancer
risks and screening guidelines differ between FAP and AFAP, please speak to
your healthcare provider to determine which apply to you.

ABOUT_GENE.CONTENT_MORE -- APC  I1307K

There have been many studies that show the _APC_ I1307K mutation is linked
to slightly increased colorectal cancer risk. Unlike some other _APC_
mutations, it is not associated with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or
Attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (AFAP). Research on this gene and
specific mutation is ongoing. The current colorectal cancer risk estimate
for _APC_ I1307K is based on studies of a specific population. As additional
information is gathered across more populations, risk estimates and
associated cancers may change. If this happens, we will try to contact you.

ABOUT_GENE.CONTENT -- ATM F

Testing positive for a <<classification>> variant (also called a mutation) in
the _ATM_ gene means your risk of developing breast cancer is greater than
that of the average US woman. Your risk of pancreatic cancer is also
increased by this mutation.

ABOUT_GENE.CONTENT -- ATM M

Testing positive for a <<classification>> variant (also called a mutation) in
the _ATM_ gene means your risks of developing pancreatic and prostate cancers
are greater than that of the average US man.

ABOUT_GENE.CONTENT -- BAP1

Testing positive for a <<classification>> variant (also called a mutation) in
the _BAP1_ gene means your risk of developing melanoma of the eye and skin is
greater than that of the average US <<man/woman>>. Your risks of kidney and lung
(specifically a type called mesothelioma) cancer are also increased by this mutation.
