GENERAL:

A pathogenic mutation was found in your _<<gene>>_ gene.
This means that your chances of being eaten alive are
greater than for the average US <<man/woman>>.

This result does not mean that an animal is stalking you now,
or that you will be eaten in the future.  Discuss these results
with your local wildlife warden to determine the best
ways to miminize your risk.[[Thompson01]]

Monitoring of native and exotic carnivores is ongoing, and if
any studies show increasing numbers of them in your area we
will try to contact you.

SPECIFIC TO TIGER:

A pathogenic mutation was found in your _TIGR_ gene.
This means that your chances of being eaten alive are
greater than for the average US <<man/woman>>, but
these risks are computed based on studies of other
carnivores.  Your risk may be lower because the nearest
natural tiger habitat is over 7000 miles from the US.[[Thompson01,Tripathi16]]

ABOUT:

Bears are native to North America, although they are
rarely found in urban areas.  They usually avoid people,
but if provoked may attack.  A variety of bear known
as the Brown Bear (_ursus arctos_) is particularly dangerous,
because they are big, strong, and just plain ornery.

Tigers are native to Asia, and while they are able to swim,
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are too wide for them to
cross.  Rare fatal attacks in North America have been reported,
but primarily from captive animals with deficient obedience
training.[[Gumaste15]]

Lions live primarily in Africa, and do not thrive in the
climate of the northern US and Canada.  Their paws are
poorly suited for snow, and they have trouble finding food
because they are not allowed in most supermarkets.
